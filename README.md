This project aims to design and prototype a sport specific prosthetic device specially for Aaron, a passionate bushwalker and rock climber who lost his right forearm due to a traumatic accident. The prosthetic aims to restore his ability to climb, in some extent, and perform essential daily tasks by integrating responsive, sensor activated controls.
