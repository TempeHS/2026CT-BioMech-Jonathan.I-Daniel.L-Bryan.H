# Jira Arm

This project aims to design and prototype a prosthetic device specially for Aaron, a passionate bushwalker and rock climber who lost his right forearm due to a traumatic incident where his forearm was crushed by a boulder. The prosthetic aims to restore his ability to climb, in some extent, and perform essential daily tasks.
