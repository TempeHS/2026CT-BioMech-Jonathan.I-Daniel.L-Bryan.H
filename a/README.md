This project aims to create a wearable navigation device that allow Kaia, a blind Year 8 student from the Tongan Islands, to move independently through her school environment. Using a combination of ultrasonic sensors, time-of-flight distance measurement, and vibration motors, the device will detect nearby obstacles and provide real-time tactile feedback. A buzzer will offer auditory alerts for critical hazards, while a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope will track Kaia’s movement and orientation. A manual override button will allow Kaia to signal for help or reset the system when needed.
