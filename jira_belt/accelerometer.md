Notes: 
Find way to use +
(set up on i2c)

also has a temp sensor 

  Purpose: Read 6-axis motion data (accelerometer + gyroscope)
  Notes:
  1. Connect to I2C port
  2. Accelerometer measures linear acceleration (g)
  3. Gyroscope measures angular velocity (degrees/second)
  4. Combined data enables orientation tracking
  5. Temperature sensor built-in
