Notes: 
link to dah distance sensor for location

  Purpose: Control vibration motor for haptic feedback
  Notes:
    1. Connect to digital port (D2-D8)
    2. HIGH = motor ON, LOW = motor OFF
    3. Can use PWM (analogWrite) for variable intensity
    4. Motor draws 50-150mA when active
    5. Add delays for distinct vibration patterns
